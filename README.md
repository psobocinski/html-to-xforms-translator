I wrote this HTML to XForms translator back in 2006 for this XML.com article: [Migrating to XForms](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/11/01/migrating-to-xforms-php.html). Unfortunately XForms haven't caught on as I had predicted in the article. Despite this, I've added the code to GitHub in case others find it useful in some way.
